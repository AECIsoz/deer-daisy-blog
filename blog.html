            <p class="first-paragraph">Eliselundsvägen 2, Kivik, is for sale. It's the summer of 2019 and I believe I have found the perfect
                location for The Deer & Daisy. Walking in through those red double doors I can feel the inspiration
                take hold of me and put ideas in my head. The business plan for the small village inn is already 
                written and I know what I'm looking for. So what is it that I see at Eliselundsvägen 2?
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all - a lot of space! The main house is three stories with a full height cellar, spacious 
                ground floor with kitchen and open plan dining room and lounge, and two bedrooms and a large bathroom 
                on the top floor. The second house on the property is a two storey cottage that you enter through a 
                conservatory. There are three bedrooms upstairs and an open plan layout downstairs with lounch, kitchen, 
                dining area and a small bathroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The garden is huge, nearly 3000 square meters, with a gazebo, two ponds, a fig tree, a walnut tree, fruit
                trees, esparagus plants and much more. The garden shed is a 60 squre meter space with dirt floor and high 
                celing with rafters.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'd have to be asleep not to see the potential! Not only is this a charming house, the whole place is enchanted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Second of all - the location! It's on the main road, a little bit set apart from the other houses in the
                street. It's walking distance from the harbour and old Kivik, but not tucked away in a small alley. Everyone
                walking, cycling, riding the bus or driving through the village will pass by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third of all - the most cruical advantage with this property I had yet to discover. When I bought it I had no idea
                that it was not part of any zoning, it had no designated use. Had it been I would never have been able to 
                change the use of the house from private residence to business use. As fate would have it I bought one of 
                only three houses in Kivik that would not need rezoning to fulfil it's purpose as my dream come true. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Luck is very much part of my story so far.
