                    I've lived in the house for two years now and it's like living in a play house. Nothing is for real, 
                    permanent, normal. It's not my home and it's not a business - yet. It's a house where I stay and 
                    potter around and play at opening a pub. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The house itself is kind, friendly. From the first day I spent here I have never felt anything but 
                    safe and welcome. It smells nice. It is quirky. There is nothing I need to be particularly careful with. 
                    That's why it feels like a play house - because I can do with it whatever I want and it seems to like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wonderful people who lived here before left a lot of stuff. Furniture, tools, building materials,
                     interior decorations. That's a good thing because the furniture I brought from Stockholm fit a 63 square metre
                     appartment. The gardening equipment alone was worth a fortune. And everything well looked after and neatly 
                     stored. Now, when I want to build a prototype bar, all I have to do is go out into the huge shed and choose some
                     planks, scoure the house for spare furniture and get creative. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bought a three metre Italian unit on Blocket for the back of the bar. It's a bit low but I've raised it with
                    spare planks and will build a proper plinth for when we're going real. I love the dark wood and the colour is going to
                    be the template for the wood panelling that will cover most of the walls of the pub. 
                </p>

                <p class="first-paragraph">Eliselundsvägen 2, Kivik, is for sale. It's the summer of 2019 and I believe I have found the perfect
                    location for The Deer & Daisy. Walking in through those red double doors I can feel the inspiration
                    take hold of me and put ideas in my head. The business plan for the small village inn is already 
                    written and I know what I'm looking for. So what is it that I see at Eliselundsvägen 2?
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all - a lot of space! The main house is three stories with a full height cellar, spacious 
                    ground floor with kitchen and open plan dining room and lounge, and two bedrooms and a large bathroom 
                    on the top floor. The second house on the property is a two storey cottage that you enter through a 
                    conservatory. There are three bedrooms upstairs and an open plan layout downstairs with lounch, kitchen, 
                    dining area and a small bathroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The garden is huge, nearly 3000 square meters, with a gazebo, two ponds, a fig tree, a walnut tree, fruit
                    trees, esparagus plants and much more. The garden shed is a 60 squre meter space with dirt floor and high 
                    celing with rafters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'd have to be asleep not to see the potential! Not only is this a charming house, the whole place is enchanted. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second of all - the location! It's on the main road, a little bit set apart from the other houses in the
                    street. It's walking distance from the harbour and old Kivik, but not tucked away in a small alley. Everyone
                    walking, cycling, riding the bus or driving through the village will pass by it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third of all - the most cruical advantage with this property I had yet to discover. When I bought it I had no idea
                    that it was not part of any zoning (detaljplan), it had no designated use. Had it been zoned I would never have been able to 
                    change the use of the house from private residence to business use. As fate would have it I bought one of 
                    only three houses in Kivik that would not need rezoning to fulfil it's purpose as my dream come true. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luck is very much part of my story so far.
